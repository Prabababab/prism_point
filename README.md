# Prism Point

"What is the point of this project?", you might ask.

This repository is code to a robot challenge that we wanted to solve.

Here is the set-up:

There is an apparatus with a prism attached. The prism can be physically moved
with the apparatus, or it can rotate in place.

We, the testers, will shine a light in the range of motion of the prism. The prism
then must be able to direct that light to a bullseye set up (there are limits to)
where it can aim.

This project will be done in Java.
